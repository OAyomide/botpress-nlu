# Botpress NLU âš¡

Botpress NLU is a Botpress module that adds NLU capatibilities to your bot by connecting to the NLU provider of your choice.

---

We believe NLP/NLU is a commodity, so this package abstracts the provider by providing a standard, clean interface that allows you (and the non-technicals) to easily edit the NLU data within Botpress.

With Botpress NLU,

- You own your data
- You can seamlessly switch to another NLP provider
- _(soon)_ You can continously train your bot on misunderstood phrases
- _(soon)_ You can share and import open-source, community-curated intents & entities
